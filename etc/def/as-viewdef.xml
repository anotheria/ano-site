	<!--  AnoSite supports following embedded user roles
		developer: a developer who works on the code, has access to almost anything.
		editor: the content editor, has access to content only.
		producer: the designer or html producer who can access site meta info and layout
		we suggest that you also insert an admin role to protect sensitive information like payment.
